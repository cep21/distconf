# Contributing

Contributions welcome!  Submit a pull request on github and make sure your code passes `make lint test`.  For
large changes, I strongly recommend [creating an issue](https://github.com/cep21/distconf/issues) on GitHub first to
confirm your change will be accepted before writing a lot of code.  GitHub issues are also recommended, at your discretion,
for smaller changes or questions.
